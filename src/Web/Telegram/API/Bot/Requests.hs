Targets: 1) users that are @mentioned in the text of the Message object; 2) if the bot's message is a reply (has reply_to_message_id), sender of the original message.    Example: A user votes in a poll, bot returns confirmation message in reply to the vote and hides keyboard for that user, while still showing the keyboard with poll options to users who haven't voted yet.
